# About me

## My Motivation

The internet was imagined as a global network of information shared and enriched by millions of people.
The internet of today contrasts drastically from this open and accessible web of knowledge. Massive global organisations like Google, Facebook and Amazon (the Tripoly) control over 70% of the internet traffic. They effectively wrap users in their cocoon of services and sell an 'improved' experience of the internet.

I work for a web that is open, accessible by all, and in which every voice has it's place.
I strive to keep the internet inclusive and weird, rather than a streamlined consumer experience of the corporate giants. The web is a medium for artistic expression and voicing ideas - a virtual channel to connect people around the world.

I refuse to work in certain domains which I think exploit the internet users through channels imposed by the monopolies imposed by the Tripoly. These areas are advertisment technology, and financial technology.

I support grassroot projects, NGOs, cooperatives, artists, Open-source projects, small to medium-sized companies and institutions which make resources available to the public, like universities working towards the Open Access pubication scheme.

Don't hesitate to contact me to get to know more!
