What draws me into working as a software developer is the exchange of complex ideas and their real-world implementation and active use. Similar to mathematics, programming is the expression of logic applied to the problems of digital representation of our environment. I find it very satisfying to build an application that manages to communicate with other systems. In a way it embodies the connection of the ideas embedded in their designs. So as systems communicate with systems, they are in a way networks of ideas cooperating with each other.

My educational background is in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. I earned a first class Bachelor of Science with Honours degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in 2012. Since then I have both worked as a freelancer as well as in different companies.

Through my work as a freelancer I found that communication is often more important than the code or cutting edge technology. While my recent experience working full-time at Altitude Sports has challenged the efficiency of my workflows as well as my attitude towards third party software. These experiences have lead me to adopt a more hands-on, read-the-code, make-it-fit kind of mentality, along with a better approach to scoping tasks and time management. With this combined experience I now build more robust enterprise level applications using modern software engineering techniques that meet the acceptance criteria of my clients, and using up-to-date tools.

As a long term goal, I would like to move more into the world of Quality Assurance (QA) and testing, as well as the blurry realm of DevOps. I am using docker in my current development workflow and want to expand to using Ansible and Github hooks to enable a continuous integration workflow. Besides I would like to leverage the portability of laptops and the internet to work remotely more so that I can explore our beautiful little planet as well as to maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
