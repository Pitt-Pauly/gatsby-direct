### For post-seed Start-ups & established businesses

- I build reliable and scaleable web applications
- Back-end development is my speciality - meaning I get the engine going of your web app by setting up your cloud hosting environment to host your app, following best practices in security and fault-tolerant distributed systems.
- I work with Docker to containerize your apps enabling a more efficient development and deployment workflow as well as Continuous Testing, Integration, and Deployment flows.
- I provide support integrating your third party applications with your inhouse apps
- I develop APIs to provide external and/or internal services to your users


I am in general technology agnostic, meaning I use the technolgies that are right for the job rather than limiting the project to the technologies that I am familiar with. 
Among the technologies I have used are: 
- the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql/MariaDB, PHP),
- I have developed extensively with PHP, developing apps using Laravel and Lumen
- I used Python for machine learning tasks as well as server side scripting and web development with frameworks like Django and Flask
- I am amazed by Nodejs and Javascript as a whole and am actively using EC6 and Babel to develop my apps (this site is built using Gatsby, a static site generator running on Nodejs and generating Reactjs objects!)
